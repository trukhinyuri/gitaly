	// When deleting references, git has to delete them both in the packed-refs backend as well
	// as any loose refs -- if only the loose ref was deleted, it would potentially unshadow the
	// value contained in the packed-refs file and vice versa. As a result, git will create two
	// transactions when any ref exists in both backends: one session to force-delete all
	// existing refs in the packed-refs backend, and then one transaction to update all loose
	// refs. This is problematic for us, as our voting logic now requires all nodes to have the
	// same packed state, which we do not and cannot guarantee.
	//
	// We're lucky though and can fix this quite easily: git only needs to cope with unshadowing
	// refs when deleting loose refs, so it will only ever _delete_ refs from the packed-refs
	// backend and never _update_ any refs. And if such a force-deletion happens, the same
	// deletion will also get queued to the loose backend no matter whether the loose ref exists
	// or not given that it must be locked during the whole transaction. As such, we can easily
	// recognize those packed-refs cleanups: all queued ref updates are force deletions.
	//
	// The workaround is thus clear: we simply do not cast a vote on any reference transaction
	// which consists only of force-deletions -- the vote will instead only happen on the loose
	// backend transaction, which contains the full record of all refs which are to be updated.
